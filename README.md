# NoteKeeper

This is an Android App for taking notes for different school subjects. The project is created with Java and XML in Andorid Studio.

EXTERNAL FILES:
/app/src/main/java/com/jwhh/notekeeper/CourseInfo.java
/app/src/main/java/com/jwhh/notekeeper/DataManager.java
/app/src/main/java/com/jwhh/notekeeper/ModuleInfo.java
/app/src/main/java/com/jwhh/notekeeper/NoteInfo.java

These four files store the data for school subjects and content of notes for each class. I did not write these files.
